# Talent_Connect

The Talent Connect Portal is a web application created for the CIT6224 Web Application
Development course at Multimedia University (MMU) with the purpose of enabling
students to exhibit their skills and portfolios digitally. The portal enables MMU students
to create profiles, upload work samples, and network with other students, faculty
members, or prospective employers.
Users can register and manage accounts within the system as well as upload
achievements, display creative work, and access a talent directory showcasing
numerous fields such as information technology, art, music, writing, etc. Admin users
have privileges to edit site content including managing talent submissions and
approving user-generated content as well as issuing site-wide critical announcements.
This project captures the essence of full-stack development where students integrate
UI/UX design alongside databases for this capstone project.
The system is built using MySQL databases alongside PHP for server-side work and
client side HTML/CSS/JavaScript frameworks. The entire system is hosted locally on an
XAMPP server with multimedia instructional interfaces copyrighted within. Streamlined
user experience for multimedia access along with robust interface security enhances
structural submission validation.
Objective
The primary objectives of the Talent Connect Portal are:
• To develop a fully functional web platform that allows MMU students to create
and manage talent profiles.
• To implement secure user authentication and authorization for students and
administrators.
• To create an e-catalogue system that allows users to browse and search for
talents across diUerent categories.
• To support media uploads, allowing students to showcase their work through
images and files.
• To enable administrators to manage content such as user information, feedback,
and announcements.
• To ensure proper data validation and secure backend operations using PHP and
MySQL.
• To enhance students’ practical skills in full-stack web development using core
web technologies.
Project scope
The scope of the Talent Connect Portal project encompasses the development of a full-
featured web application that allows MMU students to showcase their talents in a
structured and professional digital environment. The system is comprised of both an
interactive frontend and a backend which have been developed with HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. With the frontend being a presentation of the interface
displaying an organised layout with each space being able to be clearly identified by
users, which navigates easily via a main menu with icons with visual and interactive
elements such as forms that have validation and feedback for users.
The parts of the backend that have been planned out are that all users that register or
login will be authenticated which includes defining the type of users logging in as either
students or admin. The students can create and update their own profile and upload a
profile image and upload their portfolio files. An e-catalogue system that lists the
talents of all of the registered users is considered in the portal and is visible to other
users. The portal has admin functionality, so administrators can login and see
dashboards that perform a list of searches to manage user entries, post
announcements and look at feedback submitted by students. The feedback is there for
users to have a place to add anything from queries to comments and they are securely
recorded in the database. All of the user data and information/content from the system
is configured to speak to a MySQL database and the data for users accessed securely to
the database via PHP as PDO. The overall scope places focus on delivering a secure,
organized and functional web application that is relevant to the significant requirements
outlined in the course assignment brief
